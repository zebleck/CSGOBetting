Programming a program to help people betting

Hi, the program created with this code should help everyone, who bets skins in 
Counter-Strike : Global-Offensive. It provides information on upcomming matches,
so you can decide more easily, on which team you're gonna bet.
It's open source, so everyone can look at the code and help.
It doesn't have a jar, with which you can run the program easily yet though.
Have fun with it and good luck betting!
